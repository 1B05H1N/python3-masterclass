Hints for the next lesson:

    States of the USA

    Plotting Problems

Note 1: The states of the USA

The states of the USA can be found here - California has the abbreviation "CA" (you will need it in the next lesson).

Note 2: What to do if the plot does not work correctly?

When you run the code for the next lesson, it is possible that the graphic will not be displayed as I see it. Probably something has changed on the Matplotlib side, so the code has to be slightly adapted.

In the next lesson I pass the data to Matplotlib as a list of strings, i.e. as X-values I pass e.g. ['1910', '1911', '1912', ..., '2014'] ... This could still be plotted correctly, but occasionally this causes problems. But if you pass the x-values as a list of numbers, so [1910, 1911, 1912, ..., 2014], that should fit so far. The same applies to the Y-values, which should also be passed as a list of numbers.

So in the next lesson you will need the following code instead:

    xs.append(line_splitted[2])
    ys.append(line_splitted[5])

The code here (the int() call around it converts the type into an int):

    xs.append(int(line_splitted[2]))
    ys.append(int(line_splitted[5]))
