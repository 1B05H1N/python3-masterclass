Open, Read, Write Files

Problem: 

Up to now our variables were lost by the program after each restart

How do we manage to restart the program, but still keep the data? 

Solution:
We read/write a file!

Read File 

CSV import: 

CSV is a file format with which you can easily read in tabular data

Imagine, for example, recording an attendance list in Excel...

...if you export them as ".csv", we can read them really easily with Python
