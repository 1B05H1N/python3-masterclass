Web Development in Python: What's Next?

If you'd like to proceed learn:

	HTML + CSS (in depth)
	
	JavaScript (in depth)

	And of course Flask (there's a lot more to learn about it) / Django 

Flask - learn even more about flask and python

Learn how to use SQLAlchemy, which is required to store data in MySQL

Alternative to flask == django - can create websites and db connections without use of SQLAlchemy 

Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly with less code.
