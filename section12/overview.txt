Overview: Data Strcutures

I would like to give you a brief overview of the different data structures that you have already got to know:

List: ["Item"]

    Can be subsequently extended

    Sequence is maintained

    Elements may occur more than once

Dictionary: {"key": "value"}

    Stores an assignment of a key to a value

    Sequence is not maintained

    Values may occur more than once

    However, each key may only exist once

Set: {"Element1"}

    Can be subsequently extended

    Sequence is not maintained

    Index - notation s[15] is not supported

    Each element occurs only once

    If you want to guarantee that each element only occurs once inside - much more efficient than a list, because a set is optimized for it

Priority queue: queue.PriorityQueue()

    Optimized data structure to sort items by priority

    Elements are automatically sorted according to their priority

    Direct access to the elements is not possible

    You can only access the first item or remove the first item

    Enough for a queue by priority :)

    You don't need it as often as a list / set, but if you can use it for one purpose - then it is often significantly faster than a list for such purposes.

Tuple ("Element1", "Element2")

    Similar to a list

    Cannot be extended at a later date
