you use the while look when you know how many times you want to loop, or when you want to loop through something until a condition is met.

for loop makes sense when you want to look through a collection (list)

# while loop is good for running until a condition is met
# list, tuples, sets strings are great for for (look for something)

for i in list1:
	print(i)

# you cannot run through a list with a while loop
