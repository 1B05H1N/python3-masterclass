The Not Operator

Question 1:
The following code example is given:

age = 25
if not age > 30:
	print("hello world")

Will "hello world" be printed? 
-Yes # 25 is not greater than 30

Question 2: 
When is "hello world" printed? (a, b are True/False values)

Play through the given answer options in your head, and consider whether the whole expression is fulfilled or not. 

Code: 

if a and (not b):
	print("hello world")
- a = True, b = False

Question 3: 

A small and or or can make a big difference. For example, the following printout checks whether a call has been made during office hours (9-15:59)_:

hour >= 9 and hour < 16

Now a mistake has been made here, the following expression is inadvertently in our program:

hour >= 9 or hour < 16

For which values is the 2nd expression fulfilled? 
- All times (0 - 24 h) # greater than or equal to 9 and less than 16
