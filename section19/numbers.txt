OpenCV : Stored Numbers

Basically this applies: 

The larger the possible number, the more boxes you need

Python ensures that any number can be stored in a variable, no matter the range the this number is located

This automatic area detection requires additional memory 

This is no problem with 1 number, but this is a problem with 12 million numbers

Idea is that we limit the range of 0-255 for color values (8 bits)

For this we use a more compact representation and can now store 12 million color values and process them without issue
