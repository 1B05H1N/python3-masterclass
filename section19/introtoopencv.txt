OpenCV

Image processing with opencv

Open an image, do facial recognition, and then get into some mathematics 

Toolkit for computer vision 

Open source computer vision

Developed for C/C++ but can be controlled from python

We can see an image as a collection of pixels

Each pixel can have a brightness of 0-255 [[0,255,127],[255,0,127],127,0,255]]

An image is nothing more than a multidimensional array of pixels

OpenCV can handle a large amount of data without a lot of problems

In python it uses Numpy 

A color image stores 3 color values for each pixes (RGB)

In OpenCV, order is reversed (BGR)

Images can be stored as 3d arrays
