The Data Science Stack

In order to analyze data

Stack in Python

Explanation of terms:
	Data Science: Science of large data volumes 

	Stack: Stuff that is on top of each other (builds on each other)

	What is the Data Science stack doing in Python now?

Situation: 

	So far we can already develop small programs in Python

	And:

		When we want to evaluate data, we often have a similar workflow 

		Load data, display data in the table, draw a diagram from the data (make conclusions)

Solutions:
	
	We use additional tools that relieve us of these tasks

	This allow us to evaluate data faster, since we no longer have to code everything ourselves

	We also become more flexible - for example you can open real Excel files with the pandas tool from the Data Science stack.

But how is the Data Science Stack structured? 

	The Data Science stack consists of different tools that complement each other, build on each other, etc.

Overview:

Python
Layer above 
Jupyter - sits on top of Python
IPython - interlink of Jupyter/Python
NumPy - tool which allows us to do mathematical calculations 
Layer above 
matplotlib
pandas - data structures / data analytics
SymPy - python library for symbolic mathematics
scikit learn - ml
PyTables - hierarchical data sets 
Apache Spark - large scale data processing (can be combined with sql), runs on everything
