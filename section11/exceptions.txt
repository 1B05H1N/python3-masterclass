Exceptions in Python

Problem:
Occasionally, things can happen that we didn't expect to happen. 

Example: We read a file, and all of the sudden the hard disk crashes, and the file can no longer be read.

Or: We try to read a file from the Internet and the file no longer exists

Solution:

We write our program as if the problem would never occur

And if it does occur, an exception will be thrown

By default, the program is then terminated 

But we can also get involved in this process and react to an unexpected error

Important: 

Don't abuse exceptions

Really only use them for "critical" errors that occur quite rarely 

In the next lesson you will learn how exceptions work in Python :)
