Modules in Python

Problem:

Until now our code was only ever in one file

What do we do if our application becomes really comprehensive/big/broad? 

We don't want to have 10k lines of code in 1 file

Solution:

We divide our code into modules

This allows us to develop modules separately from each other

And then finally load into our program

Modules can be thought of as puzzle pieces that fit together 

Modules:

Embed and load another file
Different import - ways to load a module
Modules in a folder
	Not a good idea

Example of a module integrated in Python: csv
