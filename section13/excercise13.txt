Exercise: Functions Parameters and Lambda Functions

We would like to practice this a bit now... Therefore I have prepared another exercise sheet for you :)

You can find this exercise sheet in the course materials you downloaded in the first section. It is located in the folder "13, 14, 15 - Miscellaneous", the file is called "Exercise function parameters".

Have fun with the tasks! :)
