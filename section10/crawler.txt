We want to extract data from a website

Idea: We write a program in Python, which retrieves the website and then extracts the data from it

We want to extract data from a website

1. We call up the website (HTML)
2. ...and then extract the relevant data from it

What happens in the background? 

Python makes a request to the server

Python can read the response (HTML) and extract the relevant data from it

We will use the following tools:

Requests: 
This allows us to easily access the HTML code of the page

Beautiful soup:
This allows us to conveniently extract the data from the HTML code

Example

What could you use a crawler for? 
Get me the current share prices
Read a message page, and write all headlines into a .csv file
Extract information from an extensive product catalog

You're not supposed to break a site
