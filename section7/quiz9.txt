Dictionaries

Question 1:

Which code defines a dictionary? 
- {"Trump": "USA", "Merkel": "Germany"} # dictionaries are initialized with curly braces and are key value pairs of immutable data types separated by a comma

Question 2:

We have defined a dictionary as follows:

    d = {"Trump": "USA", "Merkel": "Germany"}

How do we access the first entry (Trump / USA)? 
- print(d["Trump"]) # dictionary is not a list so you can't call the position, and printing USA from the dictionary will not work

Question 3:

We have defined a dictionary as follows:

d = {"Trump": "USA", "Merkel": "Deutschland"}

How do you check if the entry (Trump / USA) is contained in the Dictionary?
-"Trump" in d # print(d[Trump"]) will work, the others will not work
