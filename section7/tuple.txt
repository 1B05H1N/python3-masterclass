Tuple

Problem:

Sometimes we just want to quickly group 2 values together

So e.g first name + last name

However, we would like to have separate access to the values

We also need tuples if want a function to return multiple values:

	Imagine e.g. a function "getStudent()", which should return both the first name and the last name - this is not possible without a tuple
