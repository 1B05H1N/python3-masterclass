# python3

These files were created while completing the "Python for beginners, Learn Python Programming and build your own Python programs: Data Science, Machine Learning, etc." udemy course found at https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-masterclass. 

Python was ran via sublime text, and code pushed to github via sublime merge or github desktop.

Note:
You may notice that I stop using "%matplotlib" in section 9. I had trouble getting matplotlib to work with Sublime Text 3 on Windows, so I was using jupyter notebooks. I fixed the issue with Sublime by following instructions found at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17726. The issue was resolved by uninstalling pandas, installing numpy v1.19.3 and then reinstalling pandas.
