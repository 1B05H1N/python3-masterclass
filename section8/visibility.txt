Python

Visibility of Methods and Variables

How a variable is visibile from a specific point of view

Visibility of methods and variables

Example:

Imagine, we want to model a supermarket

All that is important to us is that we can shop in the supermarket

So we need the following method:

shopping()

Example:

But for supermarket to work, many different things are needed. 

Cashiers (m/f) must be employed

Electricity must be paid for

New products must be ordered

Example: 

As a customer, I'm not supposed to notice any of this - I'm just supposed to be able to shop. 

It would be best if things were "hidden" from me as a customer

As a customer I can only shop

As a customer I cannot go to the supermarket and order more apples - only the store manager decides whether or not to order more apples. 

Result: 

As a customer I only have access to certain functionalities 

I am not allowed / not able to access the rest 

This is what now an example "from real life"

But, transferred to python: 

Tool that downloads a web page

How exactly the data packets are sent over the Internet is none of my business as a user

The only thing relevant to me is that the website is being downloaded. I'm not interested in the background procedures. 

Solution: 

Visibility of methods and variables

We can hide methods and variables for parts of our source code

Private vs public classes
