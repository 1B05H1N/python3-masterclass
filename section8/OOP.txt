Python:

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Problem:

So far we can already create functions and variables

But many "loose" functions / variables quickly become confusing...

Example of student: 

First name
Last name
Age
Subject
getFullName()

Solution:

Object orientation

This allows us to bundle all such functions

And our code will be much cleaner and clearer 

We can call properties of student. This allow us to use modules (classes that other people created).
