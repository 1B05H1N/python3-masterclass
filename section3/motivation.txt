Motivation

So far you are still learning the basics of the programming language python. Everything will build on this later - so stick to it. 

For example, lists appear in almost every program written in Python. Also here in the course, we use them for example...

...for out crawler, where you extract data from a website (we create a list form the headlines of articles)

...for DataScience, we analyze large amounts of data (data is available as a list)

...for out desktop application, where we write a tool that manages students (the students are available as a list)

...for out web application, where we calculate an exchange rate table 

...in addition, of course, with various other examples and exercises 

So stick with it any case! :D
