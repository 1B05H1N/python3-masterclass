Special characters and coding

Problem:
How does a computer put a letter internally?

Somehow with 0s and 1s

ASCII

ASCII (7 bit)

Idea: We assign letters to different combinations of nummbers

110 0001 = 0x61 = a
110 0010 = 0x62 = b

ISO 8859-1

ISO-8859-1:

Idea: We extend the ASCII - range to 8 bit, so we have twice as many characters available

96 additional characters allow us to cover common Western European characters...

ISO 8859-11:

Idea: We extend ASCII - range to 8 bit, so we can have twice as many characters available 

88 additional characters allow us to display common Thai characters...

Problem: competing ISOs with same hex value for 2 different values

We need to know in which character set a file is present in order to be able to read it correctly

This used to go quite well

But nowadays in time of the Internet we need 1 to rule them all

Solution: One characters set for all 

Solution: UTF-8
One character set for all characters

No matter what type

One characters requires between 8 and 32 bits

But practically all characters are supported

And of course all emojis are supported!
